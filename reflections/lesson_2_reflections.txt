What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Nothing besides a .git directory created. This tells GIT to prepare for version control..

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 
 staging area tells GIT what to pay attention to. Working area is a playground where one can make
 changes. The working are contains a snapshot of a portion of the working directory at a point
 in time..
